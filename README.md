Introduction
============

GRACO is a web based financial system for steel/metal warehouse and
workshop. It consists of several modules which are: Account Payable, Account
Receivable, Inventory and General Ledger.

Features
============
1. Database-Independent Access Layer:
All modules work with all SQL-compliance databases since there is a
clean separation of code between business rules, presentation layer and database layer.
2. Access Control List:
Every user has its own access control list which defines which menu and
action he/she can use. A collection of menu and action can be assigned into one role
and a user can be assigned into several roles. This feature provides a flexible way of
managing business  function as well as security.
3. PDF Output:
Report can be printed/saved as PDF file
