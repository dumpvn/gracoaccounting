=Introduction=
GRACO is a web based financial system for steel/metal warehouse and workshop. <br>
It consists of several modules which are: Account Payable, Account Receivable, <br>
Inventory and General Ledger.<br>
<br>
=Features=
1. Database-Independent Access Layer: <br>
All modules work with all SQL-compliance databases since there is a clean separation <br>
of code between business rules, presentation layer and database layer. <br>
2. Access Control List:<br>
Every user has its own access control list which defines which menu and action he/she <br>
can use. A collection of menu and action can be assigned into one role and a user can <br>
be assigned into several roles. This feature provides a flexible way of managing business<br>
function as well as security. <br>
3. PDF Output:<br>
